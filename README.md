### README

**Koinonia** is an imaginary nondenominational Christian congregation, whose
homepage is contained in this Ruby on Rails project. Using the
internationalization capabilities in the `rails-i18n` package,
the <a href="http://3.145.48.250:3000/" target="_blank">site</a> presents
two separate versions of a "welcome" page--one in English, the other in Spanish.

#### Requirements

* Ruby 3.3.1

* Rails 7.1.5

* `rails-i18n`

This project was created as the **first** in a series of three submissions
in support of my job application with the Center for Congregations in
Indianapolis. The <a href="https://www.blurve-demo.com/cfc.pdf">second</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/wrycoder/cfc">third</a> projects will be submitted
separately.
